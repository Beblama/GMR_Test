# GMR_Test
Technical test done for Giant Monkey Robot interview process.

Notes:

The table will instantiate columns and rows with Text fields.
The table will adjust and add extra rows to fit any extra "Team Member".

Desclaimer: I was not able to do the same with the Columns/any extra categories.
I was unable to figure out a way to use the ColumnHeaders strings as variables.
If you wish to add another column, public strings must be added at the DataContent.cs serializable
A single line of code must also be added to the JsonReader.cs at line92, where each column gets to display their information.
